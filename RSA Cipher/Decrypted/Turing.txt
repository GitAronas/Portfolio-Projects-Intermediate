Alan Mathison Turing was a British cryptanalyst and computer scientist. He was highly influential in the development of computer science and provided a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine. Turing is widely considered to be the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II he worked for the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.
